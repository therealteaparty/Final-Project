## Final-Project
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2023

## Theme
Inside Out: We interpreted the theme as a squid monster who is inside of a vending machine, but avoiding being caught and taken out. If the player loses, the squid falls out of the vending machine. If he stays inside until the end, he can celebrate by eating the snacks. 
		
## Gameplay
The objective is to remain in the vending machine by hopping between snack slots until the timer runs out. The player can use WASD to move between slots and has to avoid the highlighted numbers corresponding to their location. They can also collect candies, which is an incentive to move around and risk being caught. 

## Impediments
We struggled with organizing our ideas and staying on track with our priorities. We faces some leaky abstractions with trying to merge our branches together, and we had to dive deeply into lines of code to fix the issue. We also struggled a bit with trying to create a new movement mechanic system which we had never done before in previous projects.

## Implementation
Built with Godot 4.1
Features: Collectable items, randomization, involved HUD, original assets/OST, sound effects.
We created all origional art, music, and animations for this game. Specifically we made a background, multiple snack assets, a animated character, and multiple end screen animations.
